Component Name: fips_java_api, Version: 1.9.5 -->
Found CPE entry for component --> Title: Bouncy Castle FIPS Java API 1.0.2
Found 1 total CVEs/vulnerabilities for component.
1. ID: CVE-2022-45146, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2022-11-21T10:15:31.593, Description: An issue was discovered in the FIPS Java API of Bouncy Castle BC-FJA before 1.0.2.4. Changes to the JVM garbage collector in Java 13 and later trigger an issue in the BC-FJA FIPS modules where it is possible for temporary keys used by the module to be zeroed out while still in use by the module, resulting in errors or potential information loss. NOTE: FIPS compliant users are unaffected because the FIPS certification is only for Java 7, 8, and 11.

1. ID: CVE-2021-37136, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2021-10-19T15:15:07.697, Description: The Bzip2 decompression decoder function doesn't allow setting size restrictions on the decompressed output data (which affects the allocation size used during decompression). All users of Bzip2Decoder are affected. The malicious input can trigger an OOME and so a DoS attack
2. ID: CVE-2021-37137, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2021-10-19T15:15:07.757, Description: The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.
3. ID: CVE-2021-43797, Status: Modified, Published: 2021-12-09T19:15:07.960, Description: Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. Netty prior to version 4.1.71.Final skips control chars when they are present at the beginning / end of the header name. It should instead fail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do the validation might cause netty to "sanitize" header names before it forward these to another remote system when used as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage anymore, and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.71.Final.
4. ID: CVE-2022-24823, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2022-05-06T12:15:08.163, Description: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.
5. ID: CVE-2022-41881, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2022-12-12T18:15:12.773, Description: Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.86.Final, a StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an infinite recursion. This issue is patched in version 4.1.86.Final. There is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.
6. ID: CVE-2022-41915, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2022-12-13T07:15:13.557, Description: Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.86.Final, when calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an _iterator_ of values, header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in the iterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has been patched in version 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work around the issue by changing the `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()` call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.

Component Name: user-login-history, Version: 1.5 -->
Found CPE entry for component --> Title: Pivotal Software Spring Data Commons 1.6.2
Found 1 total CVEs/vulnerabilities for component.
1. ID: CVE-2018-1273, Status: Modified, Published: 2018-04-11T13:29:00.290, Description: Spring Data Commons, versions prior to 1.13 to 1.13.10, 2.0 to 2.0.5, and older unsupported versions, contain a property binder vulnerability caused by improper neutralization of special elements. An unauthenticated remote malicious user (or attacker) can supply specially crafted request parameters against Spring Data REST backed HTTP resources or using Spring Data's projection-based request payload binding hat can lead to a remote code execution attack.

Component Name: hazelcast, Version: 1.9.3 -->

1. ID: CVE-2016-10750, Status: Modified, Published: 2019-05-22T14:29:00.223, Description: In Hazelcast before 3.11, the cluster join procedure is vulnerable to remote code execution via Java deserialization. If an attacker can reach a listening Hazelcast instance with a crafted JoinRequest, and vulnerable classes exist in the classpath, the attacker can run arbitrary code.

1. ID: CVE-2021-26557, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2021-10-07T01:15:07.057, Description: When Octopus Tentacle is installed using a custom folder location, folder ACLs are not set correctly and could lead to an unprivileged user using DLL side-loading to gain privileged access.
2. ID: CVE-2021-31822, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2021-11-24T16:15:13.540, Description: When Octopus Tentacle is installed on a Linux operating system, the systemd service file permissions are misconfigured. This could lead to a local unprivileged user modifying the contents of the systemd service file to gain privileged access.
3. ID: CVE-2021-31821, Status: Analyzed, Published: 2022-01-19T06:15:07.057, Description: When the Windows Tentacle docker image starts up it logs all the commands that it runs along with the arguments, which writes the Octopus Server API key in plaintext. This does not affect the Linux Docker image
